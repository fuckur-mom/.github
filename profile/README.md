# Fuckur Mom Group

We're committed to ridding the world of idiots.

We hate idiots and resist idiots. Stupid people should not enter the society and harm others.

For the world, for a better future, we co-founded this project.

Don't get me wrong, we have all the respect for your mother.

## Content

We power your creations by providing CNAME record subdomains or NS record subdomains.

Before you submit, you need to make sure your situation meets our requirements. We have the following requirements for submitted applications:

* You must open source the code of the applications you deploy using the subdomain under any license.
* You may not monetize the applications deployed by the subdomain in any way, except for non-mandatory donations.
* You are not allowed to deploy service projects such as IDC and Image Storage Service in subdomains. However, display sites such as personal blogs are allowed.
* Subdomains with specific meanings such as www, ftp, blog, etc. cannot be applied for.
* You need to keep your applications running for a long time. In the event of multiple service interruptions, we will cancel the resolution of your subdomain.
* You must deploy your applications legally, not from your home PC.

There are strict formatting requirements to follow for your application:

* You need to point out what the idiot did, write it as best you can!
* You need to identify yourself and leave your contact details so we can better communicate with you.
* If authenticated, you have unlimited access to subdomains which begin with your name, which is discouraged but considered cool.

The application format is as follows:

* Your name
* Your contact
* Your project name
* The type of subdomain you are applying for
* What idiots do (detailed description)
* Idiots' contact
